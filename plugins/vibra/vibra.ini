# For each policy vibra group (other, event, ui, game) you can
# provide a comma-separated list of MCE vibra patterns. Whenever
# a group is enabled/disabled, all patterns in that group will
# be enabled/disabled in MCE. It does not make much sense to
# include a single pattern in more than one group. If you do so
# disabling will take precedence in conflicting decisions.
